Overall:
  - Basic: need to sync entire Livestock Trello board locally because I need groups in almost all apps
  - Incoming "creates" a group".  May mix with existing group into a pen.  Pen will have possibly multiple "sources".
  - Processing make a record for a group, adds "numbers" for it.  Should be able to process a "group" without an incoming record?
    * Processing operates on a pen.  Always.

Model concepts:
  - group
  - pen
  - action
    * processing (1st round, 2nd round, etc.)
    * treatment
    * move
 
  - groups can assigned at:
    * incoming - by truck or source
    * tagging - by pen
    * mixing - part of pen into another pen

  - what does ear tag tell us?
    * treatment history
    * pen they were in when they were processed 1st time

  - Therefore, a "group" can go into many pens on arrival
    and a "pen" can contain many groups.  Numbers may be uncertain at some points.

  - group numbers should add up and match purchase receipts at some point, but mixing
    and splitting on incoming makes it harder to represent.

  - group may arrive over multiple days (
