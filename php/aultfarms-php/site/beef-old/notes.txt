Groups:
  - there is a list that identifies all the incoming numbers with a group
    name (BOL:DEC-1 for "Butch Ohio Line, 1st Dec group"
  - each list has the ear tag number range for that group in the name on the card.

Shots:
  - there is a time-series of cards, with one 'date' card breaking one day from the next
  - Can get treatment by pen because that's on the card
  - any calves with fevers are on card.  Not yet tracking which treatments, but should add
    that once a suitable format is found.

Death:
  - ear tag numbers should point back to a group name, track %death for group
  - can also track number of days here vs. when died (or recorded at least)
  - any notags or tags for groups we don't have recorded should be lumped together
  - could also try to track # dead per location
  - eventually add tracker for "type" of death




Old notes:

Overall:
  - Basic: need to sync entire Livestock Trello board locally because I need groups in almost all apps
  - Incoming "creates" a group".  May mix with existing group into a pen.  Pen will have possibly multiple "sources".
  - Processing make a record for a group, adds "numbers" for it.  Should be able to process a "group" without an incoming record?
    * Processing operates on a pen.  Always.

Model concepts:
  - group
  - pen
  - action
    * processing (1st round, 2nd round, etc.)
    * treatment
    * move
 
  - groups can assigned at:
    * incoming - by truck or source
    * tagging - by pen
    * mixing - part of pen into another pen

  - what does ear tag tell us?
    * treatment history
    * pen they were in when they were processed 1st time

  - Therefore, a "group" can go into many pens on arrival
    and a "pen" can contain many groups.  Numbers may be uncertain at some points.

  - group numbers should add up and match purchase receipts at some point, but mixing
    and splitting on incoming makes it harder to represent.

  - group may arrive over multiple days (


Apps:

Immediate Needs:
  * Treatment History
    = incoming
    = treaments

- Entry:
  * Dead
  * Incoming
  * Processing
  * Move/Merge
  * Outgoing
  * Treatment
  * Weights
    - by group
    - by animal
  * Feed

- Lookup:
  * By Tag
    > mainly for treatment

- Analysis:
  * Dead stats
    - % by group
    - # by year
  * Evaluate tests
