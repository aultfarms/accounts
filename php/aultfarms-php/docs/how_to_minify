Google Closure Compiler is best option. Needs java to run, though, and
1and1 doesn't have java.  So, commit everything to git, pull on your laptop,
run:

java -jar ../../scripts/google_closure_compiler/compiler.jar --language_in ECMASCRIPT5 --js index.js --js_output_file index-min.js

Then commit, push, and pull on server.  Done.


Options:
- Go to jscompress.com
- use JSMin.php, which is in scripts/
- use the Google Closure Compiler in script/ (best option)
